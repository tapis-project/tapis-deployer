Instructions for manually migrating to a new version of postgres.
For example, from version 12.4 to version 16.
==================================================================
Service: Apps
==================================================================

There should be a directory in place for the new postgres deployment, for
example a directory named *postgres_16*.
There should also be a directory named *migrate_postgres* containing the scripts
and files to be used during the migration process.

Please follow these steps:

Example code below assumes PG_DIR_OLD and PG_DIR_NEW are set to the old and new postgres directories,
for example (see also migrate.env file):
  export PG_DIR_OLD=postgres
  export PG_DIR_NEW=postgres_16

1. Update settings in migrate_postgres/migrate.env
   - Set properties for connecting to old and new DB
   - Check and update if needed the values for PG_DIR_OLD, PG_DIR_NEW and PG_DEPLOY_NAME
   - Check and update if needed the properties for the old and new containers.

2. Shut down processes that connect to the DB, such as a front-end api service
   and any worker processes using burndown_pg_migrate:
     cd migrate_postgres
     ./burndown_pg_migrate
     cd ..

3. Backup the DB in case of any issues with the migration.

4. Bring up the new postgres without initializing the service tables using burnup_pg_migrate:
     cd migrate_postgres
     ./burnup_pg_migrate
     cd ..

5. Run the migrate script migrateDb.sh:
     cd migrate_postgres
     ./migrateDb.sh
     cd ..

6. Check the before and after table counts once the script completes.
   Results will be located in stdout from the script. Check for errors, etc.

7. Bring down the old postgres:
     cd $PG_DIR_OLD
     ./burndown
     cd ..

8. Bring up the service by running the top level burnup script.

9. Verify the service has started without errors. Check that the service is getting
   data from the new DB by calling an endpoint to list resources.

10. Once the new database has been thoroughly tested and you are confident
   everything is working as expected, the old PVC volume may be deleted.
