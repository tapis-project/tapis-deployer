The service database role (i.e. user) and schema are initially created when the postgres database for the Tapis
 service is first deployed. The script containing SQL is run using a kubernetes job.

In a Tapis deployment the files may be found under tapis-kube/<service_name>/postgres_16.
The two main files involved are *<service_name>-init-db-sh* and *<service_name>-init-db.yml*.
Burndown involves:
  kubectl delete -f <service_name>-init-db.yml
Burnup involves:
  kubectl create configmap <service_name>-init-db-configmap --from-file <service_name>-init-db-sh
  kubectl create -f <service_name>-init-db.yml
  kubectl wait --timeout=120s --for=condition=complete job/<service_name>-init-db

Each time the service starts up a flyway migration is run to bring the DB schema up to date as needed.
This happens as part of application (AppsApplication.java) startup.
The calling sequence is:
   AppsApplication.svcImpl.initService -> AppsServiceImpl.dao.migrateDB() -> AppsDaoImpl.flyway.migrate()
