## 1.3.5

**Breaking Changes**

Previous versions of Tapis Deployer have placed important vault configs in ~/vault, ~/vault-token. These files are now moved to a configurable directory set by the `tapisdatadir` variable. This should be set to the directory on your deployment machine that contains data for your installation and should

**If you migrating from an existing Tapis deployement** be sure to copy:
- create the `tapisdatadir`/vault directory
- copy ~/vault file to `tapisdatadir`/vault/vault-init file
- copy ~/vault-token file to `tapisdatadir`/vault/vault-token file

## 1.3.4

- Vault config (vault.hcl) fixes

## 1.3.3

- Updated security images to 1.3.1 

## 1.3.2

- Updated several image minor release versions. 
- Added VERSION file to reflect which version of tapis-deployer was used.

**Breaking Changes**

- If you have an existing Tapis deployment, you may be using the "file" storage type for vault. In the future the default will use "raft" storage type. For new installs, no action is required. Follow Migration steps below to migrate from file to raft storage.

### Migration from 1.2.x steps 

- Check your existing vault for storage type. Exec into the container and get storage type

    kubectl exec -it deploy/vault vault status | grep "Storage Type"
    Storage Type    file

If your storage type if "file", include this in your host_vars:

    vault_raft_storage: false

If your storage type is "raft", no further action required. Ensure that "vault_raft_storage" var is undefined in your host_vars.

## 1.3.0 

**Breaking Changes**

- Tapis Deployer 1.3.0 differs greatly from 1.2.x. Please refer to the documentation https://tapis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/technical/index.html for migration guide.  
- The template generation backend was redone using Ansible.
- The input generator is deprecated.

### Migration from 1.2.x steps 

- Remove "tokens_tenants" var from the tokens section of your input file. Is now set to ["*"] by default, meaning tokens will get a list of tenants from tenants service.
- Remove "authenticator_service_tenants" var from the authenticator section of your input file. Is now set to ["*"] by default, meaning authenticator will get a list of tenants from tenants service.
- Update your host_vars (deployer input file) to include the following new variables. (see inventory_examples for reference):

    # Choose where your deployment files should be created.
    tapisdir: '{{ ansible_env.HOME }}/tmp/{{ inventory_hostname }}'
    tapisdatadir: '{{ ansible_env.HOME }}/tmp/{{ inventory_hostname }}-data'


## 1.2.x - 2023-01-06
